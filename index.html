        Page about my pets
    </h3>
    <p>
        I have two pets: a <em>Scottish lop-eared</em> cat named <strong>Richard</strong> and an <em>ordinary white cat from the street</em> named <strong>Murka</strong>.
        <br>Richard is now 9 years old, he is an emotionally very cold breed of cat, usually they choose one owner for themselves and allow only him to touch them.
        <br>Murka is 3 years old, she is a very gentle cat, but with a very wild character, she allows you to touch anyone who feeds her))
